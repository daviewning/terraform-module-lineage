Create a python relationship application that can read terraform files and create a visual relationship map of the modules and their dependencies.

FR1: Terraform Configuration Parsing
FR1.1: Parse Terraform configuration files (.tf) and modules
FR1.2: Extract module definitions, sources, and dependencies


FR2: Dependency Analysis
FR2.1: Build dependency graph of modules and resources
FR2.2: Detect circular dependencies between modules


FR3: Visualization Generation
FR3.1: Generate interactive visualizations of module relationships
FR3.2: Support output formats HTML
FR3.3: Create hierarchical tree views of module structures
FR3.4: Generate dependency graphs with directional arrows
FR3.5: Color-code modules by type, environment, or status

FR4: User Interface
FR4.1: Command-line interface for batch processing

I already create a python virtual environment named tflaenv. You can find the instructions in create_py_environment.txt file.
the project root folder is TERRAFORM-MODULE-LINEAGE
The main application file should be named tfla.py and should be located in the root folder.
